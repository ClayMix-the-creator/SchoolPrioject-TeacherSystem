# Here we will implement receiving information from the school website
# To be honest, the code depends on the school itself
# Because some school may not have its own website
# If it does have its own website, it may not have a schedule posted on it
# And if it does have a schedule, it may have its own unique API that needs to be adjusted to
# Therefore, I will implement receiving information from the website of the school in which I study.
